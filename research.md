# Trying to see how knowledges are united
When solving one problem does not solve another, we try to see what is more fundamental problem shared between them. Eventually we reach a point where we only need to solve one problem that is for everything. If you have such a "united" problem, what we need is the "united knowledge" to give an answer to how the problem can be solved.<br>

While this subject seems to be a question only for philosophers, it demands not only conceptual views but also material-based understanding. That is when biology comes into play, probing how multiple things come together to have collective functionality at as ultimate degree as possible.
