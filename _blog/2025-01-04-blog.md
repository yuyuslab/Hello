# Why am I writing this?
My question come out of my experience in words had been "*How do people with different backgrounds achieve a common goal?*"

Recently, I had a chance to read through papers of my prospective laboratory PI (principle investigator) because his research seemed most relevant to my intersts. There I found how a big question can be decomposed into smaller materialised questions. Some of the questions are the following:

*How do agents choose one option over the other even though the latter has a better sign of its quality?*

*What is an optimum composition of a community consisting with two different propensities of agents?*

*How do agents combine different methods of decision-making behaviours?*

They are amazing in a way that they connect with known biological entities and quantitative measurements. But can't I come up with questions myself...?
