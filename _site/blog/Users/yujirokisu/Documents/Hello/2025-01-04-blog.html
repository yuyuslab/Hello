    <h1>How my question is understood and modified</h1>
<p>04 Jan 2025</p>
<h1 id="why-am-i-writing-this">Why am I writing this?</h1>
<p>My question come out of my experience in words had been “<em>How do people with different backgrounds collaborate to reach a shared goal?</em>”</p>

<p>Recently, I had a chance to read through papers of my prospective laboratory PI (principle investigator) because his research seemed most relevant to my intersts. There I found how a big question can be decomposed into smaller materialised questions. Some of the questions are the following:</p>

<p><em>How do agents choose one option over the other even though the latter has a better sign of its quality?</em></p>

<p><em>What is an optimum composition of a community consisting with two different propensities of agents?</em></p>

<p><em>How do agents combine different methods of decision-making behaviours?</em></p>

<p>They are amazing in a way that they connect with known biological entities and quantitative measurements. But can’t I come up with questions myself…?</p>

<h1 id="attempts-to-modify-my-question">Attempts to modify my question</h1>

<p>“<em>How genetically identical agents with different propensities together make an optimal decision?</em>”</p>
