    <h1>Organising my passion towards science</h1>
<p>03 Jan 2025</p>
<h1 id="why-am-i-writing-about-my-passion-for-science-now">Why am I writing about my passion for science now?</h1>
<p>I’m now about to get into my fifth year at university (the curriculum is technically fourth-year as I studied abroad for a year). I have been engaged in engineering work rather than sciency exploration. I have also organised, saying humbly, some events with help of people around me. When I studied abroad, I wanted to touch on something that people usually don’t value as much in a field of biology – Indigenous studies, philosophy, software engineering, and cognitive science.</p>

<p>Coming back to my home physically in Tokyo and consciously in biological science, I realised the power of natural science especially biology – I don’t deny my bias towards biology which fits my personality. From there I have been more leaned on training myself to develop my own research plans. Why? Just by following someone’s idea is safe but not motivating.</p>

<p>Having said that, I started from following my prospective lab boss’ ideas in a his class partly to showing him my wants to join his lab. From there it was thankful that I could start a little study with ants and simulations though it’s literally just started. I thought it was going well so I just needed to continue my style of developing ideas for research. But, thankfully, it was not that easy. In a microbiology class, I was trying to come up with a small experiment idea, which took me hours with sort of implicit tricky assists from an instructor. I did manage to make one experiment though the words from the instructor really articulated what is lacking in my scientific skills.</p>

<p>Since I was told the words, it has been my challenge to think based on my experience, which sounds sooo basic but I was just not doing that mush until now. I think it was my habit to look for information that’s already available inheritted from software development work, because I was just good at searching not remembering. Also, a firend of mine, what people think a smart guy, showed me how to connect dots of information from experiments so that they compliment each other.</p>

<p>All the things mentioned thus far happened just within a month though I realised that they were like a digests of my past several years of learning how to do science, which were not firmly dissolved in my skills so as to utilise them. But that’s okay. I have now have many indexes of various knowldge fields that I can draw on from experience. Then, I’m ready try to get my a** do science.</p>

<p>The reason why I took distance from doing science wasn’t because I’m not favour of it but I thought it wants more than what it is per se. Explicitly saying, science has got to reunite with other knowledges so that it can reach out its hands to what has not been possible. I honestly don’t know exactly how we do that yet, and that should be what I pursue after getting my masters. Why after masters? because I want to do sciency science now on for two years so that I can dissolve it in me. Then, after my masters, I can blend it with my non-sciency experiences drawn from indexes I have made past several years with new ones I’m hoping to encounter during my PhD. I care about science so I learn what’s far from science so that I can know what is good about it and what it needs others to do more.</p>
