    <h1>How do humans compromise in politics?</h1>
<p>19 Aug 2022</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Introducing the book ‚ÄúThe Spirit of Compromise.‚Äù</p>

    <p>1.1. Compromise exists in our daily lives. For example, two people argue to decide which restaurant they go to, French or Japanese, or politicians make a decision when implementing a law.</p>

    <p>1.2. In a book called ‚ÄúThe Spirit of Compromise‚Äù (citation), the authors say, ‚ÄúWithout compromise on health care and taxation or other major issues, the status quo prevails, even if it preserves a policy that serves everyone‚Äôs interests poorly and even if it leads to a major crisis (Gutmann and Thompson, 2012, p. 30).‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How compromise matters in society: ex. Election</p>

    <p>2.1. Ex. In Japan, an election is one of the ways to compromise (more detailed discussion is in ‚ÄúProblem of compromise in Japan‚Äù!)</p>

    <p>2.2 The majority gets more votes than the minority; therefore, those who got more votes need less compromise in the latter decision-making process. That‚Äôs because they can easily pass bills.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How could political compromise have experimented in biology</p>

    <p>3.1. For now, there is no clear explanation of political compromise by biology</p>

    <p>3.2. However, the concept of compromise has been studied in a pharmaceutical field</p>

    <p>3.3. Compromise can be interpreted as ‚Äúintolerance‚Äù and studied with mentally-depressed people -&gt; keyword: serotonin (Carhart-Harris &amp; Nutt, 2017)</p>

    <p>3.4. By manipulating serotonin levels, humans‚Äô compromising behavior was observed (Lichters et al., 2016)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Imaginary research proposal</p>

    <p>4.1. Although a key neurotransmitter, serotonin, was kind of identified and connected to compromising behavior</p>

    <p>4.2. Politics has not been explored by biology yet.</p>

    <p>4.3. The research by Arceneaux (2019) says, ‚ÄúAbsolutists are more likely to adopt extreme opinions, display intolerance toward political disagreement, and punish politicians who make compromises.‚Äù</p>

    <p>4.4. But political science has not been able to test if such inclination occurs because of biological substances like serotonin.</p>

    <p>4.5. Therefore, my proposal was created to test ‚Äúthe levels of serotonin in the brain influence the ability to compromise political differences.‚Äù</p>

    <p>4.6. <a href="/Hello/_research/2022-08-20-research.md">The Research Proposal</a> describes in detail!</p>
