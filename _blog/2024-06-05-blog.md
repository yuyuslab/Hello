It’s been several weeks since I have a thought in my mind about what I tend to be motivated and to be attracted by. That seems to be a a process of making a system that makes sense in a way it is intentionally directed to achieve something. So a whole system of the world might be an exception because it might not have an ultimate purpose. But the intermediate points can have purposes as they want by limiting/striping away what is already run by someone else; we can’t have everything soooo. 

Ideally or on a curiosity base, I long for a future where everyone is like a software engineer.
