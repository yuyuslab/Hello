    <h1>Choice research</h1>
<p>06 Jun 2024</p>
<p>Choice is a key word for the research done by Sheena Iyengar who visited TMU today. One  remarkable thing was how she realised interdiciplinary collaboration with this (currently its sign in system is not working)</p>

<p>She showed which component of a solution should be assigned to which agent using, I think, GPT4.</p>
